        <h6>BWB prosthetic socket team (Winter - Spring 2017)</h6>
        <h6>@BWB Club(Bioengineers Without Border)</h6>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to make a cheaper, stronger version
          of prosthetic team using materials like polypropylene instead of
          the expensive carbon material. Some part of the socket is also 3D
          printed. Now we are at the stage of designing and making
          prototypes.

        <h6>Bechdel Test (Spring 2017)</h6>
        <h6>@INFO 201 Class Final Project</h6>
        <p>
          The Bechdel Test assesses whether a movie has at least two female
          characters with names, whether they talked to each other, and
          whether their topic is about men. Many major films failed this
          test. My group wanted to raise social awareness of female role
          and we presented the analysis using R and Shiny. We made
          interactive data visualizations and gave conclusion of what we
          found. My work was the home page, the year made page, the search
          page, the about us page and I added CSS stylesheet.
