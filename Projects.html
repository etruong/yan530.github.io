        <h6>BWB prosthetic socket team (Winter - Spring 2017)</h6>
        <h6>@BWB Club(Bioengineers Without Border)</h6>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to make a cheaper, stronger version
          of prosthetic team using materials like polypropylene instead of
          the expensive carbon material. Some part of the socket is also 3D
          printed. Now we are at the stage of designing and making
          prototypes.

        <h6>Bechdel Test (Spring 2017)</h6>
        <h6>@INFO 201 Class Final Project</h6>
        <p>
          The Bechdel Test assesses whether a movie has at least two female
          characters with names, whether they talked to each other, and
          whether their topic is about men. Many major films failed this
          test. My group wanted to raise social awareness of female role
          and we presented the analysis using R and Shiny. We made
          interactive data visualizations and gave conclusion of what we
          found. My work was the home page, the year made page, the search
          page, the about us page and I added CSS stylesheet.

        <h6>Kill the Cup Challenge (Autumn 2015)</h6>
        <h6>@SEED (Student Expressing Environmental Dedication)</h6>
        <p>
          Kill the Cup Challenge is a nationwise competition that counts
          the percent of disposable cups usage in school cafe. After a month
          of advertising and tabling, University of Washington ranked top 2
          among 16 universities around the nation. I also helped organize
          many other similar events in SEED, such as "the one thing challenge"
          which encourages students to do at least one thing that's
          environmental-friendly and visiting World's greenest building
          "the Bullitt Center".

          As the SEED liaison, I'm in charge of connecting students
          with a better, greener living style. I also helped organize
          events like, Chopped (similar to the TV show), Talent Show
          , and Destress Bunny.
