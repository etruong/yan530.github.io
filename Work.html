        <h6>Teaching Assistant (Fall 2017 - present)</h6>
        <h6>@ University of Washington, Seattle, US</h6>
        <p>
          I'm currently TAing for INFO 201 (Technical Foundation
          of Informatics). I helped students with command-line,
          RStudio and API. The most fun part is to hold
          office hours and explain to students how to
          solve problems using google and stackoverflow.

        <h6>Project Manager Assistant (Summer 2017)</h6>
        <h6>@ Portedi, Ningbo, China</h6>
        <p>
          During summer, I interned at a startup company. My mento
          was kind enough to let me try project management, front-end,
          back-end, and UI designing. I learned basics of C#, Visual
          Studio, .net, flow chart, MySQL, Axure and much more. Most
          importantly, I learned how to work in a team.

        <h6>IELTS Tutor (Summer 2016)</h6>
        <h6>@ Ninbo Longre Training Center, Ningbo, China</h6>
        <p>
          I taught students English and prepared them for IELTS test.
          It was my first experience of teaching and I loved it.
          Teaching and helping others made me really happy.
          I prepared three or more hours for every class and spent a
          lot of time going over all the materials.

        <h6>@University of Washington, Seattle</h6>
        <p>
          It was my first job ever. I helped preparing food and serving food
          for students and staffs. I learned how the food system works on
          campus and I made friends with my coworkers.
